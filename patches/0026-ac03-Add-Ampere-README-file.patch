+This Docker container was built by Ampere Computing using an internal and
+proprietary build process. This container was built using sources from open source
+as well as closed source projects.
+
+The base layer of this container was built using the Ubuntu 18.04 image
+as hosted by DockerHub.
+
+A number of packages were installed using the standard apt package manager. These
+can be discovered using the ```sudo apt list --installed``` command (or equivalent).
+
+In addition to packages installed via the standard Ubuntu package repository,
+the following projects were directly added to this container:
+
+ - OpenOCD With Ampere Patches
+   Placed at location: /home/openocd/openocd/, /home/openocd/openocd/patches/
